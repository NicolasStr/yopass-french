# yopass-french

> ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French-translated Docker image for [Yopass](https://github.com/jhaals/yopass) â€“ Secure, ephemeral sharing of secrets.

---

## About

**yopass-french** is a community-maintained Docker image of [Yopass](https://github.com/jhaals/yopass) with a French language translation.  
Yopass is a tool for sharing secrets (like passwords or sensitive information) quickly and securely. Its main goal is to reduce the number of passwords circulating in emails, ticketing systems, and chat messages.

- Secrets are encrypted/decrypted locally in your browser.
- The decryption key is never sent to the server and is only shown once.
- Yopass returns a one-time URL with a configurable expiry date.

> For full details, features, and security information, please refer to the [original Yopass README](https://github.com/jhaals/yopass#readme).

## Usage

This image works exactly like the original, but with French language support.

- To use the French version, simply replace `jhaals/yopass` with `nicolasstr/yopass-french` in your Docker commands.
